# On-device AI Resources
This GitHub repository summarizes a list of **On-device AI** resources with a special focus on **Security** and **Software Engineering**.

We will keep maintaining this list in a daily or weekly manner. :wink:


#### Why On-device AI?
On-device AI enables performing inference with models directly on a device (e.g. smartphone). Compared to offloading deep learning models to the cloud, On-device AI has many advantages as follows:
- Low Latency: there is no round trip to the server and no wait for results to come back.
- Privacy: the data processing happens on users' local devices.
- Works offline: network connectivity is not required.
- No cost: paying for cloud computing cycles is not needed.

## News :mega:
28/07/2025: The repository is back to update now!\
22/11/2022: The On-device AI Resources repository is first announced!!!
