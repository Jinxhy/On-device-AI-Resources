# On-device AI Resources
This GitHub repository curates a collection of **on-device ML/DL** papers with a particular focus on **security** and **software engineering**. It includes publications from top-ti security conferences (**IEEE S&P**, **USENIX Security**, **ACM CCS**, and **NDSS**), leading software engineering conferences (**ICSE**, **FSE**, **ASE**), and high-impact journals (**TIFS**, **TDSC**, **TOSEM**, and **TSE**).

We will keep maintaining this list in a daily or weekly manner. :wink:


#### Why On-device AI?
On-device AI enables performing inference with models directly on a device (e.g. smartphone). Compared to offloading deep learning models to the cloud, On-device AI has many advantages as follows:
- Low Latency: there is no round trip to the server and no wait for results to come back.
- Privacy: the data processing happens on users' local devices.
- Works offline: network connectivity is not required.
- No cost: paying for cloud computing cycles is not needed.
